","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-06-17T08:24:45.317893Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2661659,"followers":2166,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"7JVXOe3K","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1 Forge] Mouse Tweaks 2.25.1","version_number":"1.20.1-2.25.1-forge","changelog":"- Fixed an incompatibility with certain mods that was causing a crash (specifically, Nether Chested was triggering this Mouse Tweaks issue).\n- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-12T16:27:50.280746Z","downloads":135144,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a3bb0272c0a1a3be9250dfee030bb8f86217fa6a32bd534be8c940fdd8c466c800c2df85874877983ced36ecfc28c8ced6c0d42107c1ab621385b4be9a7c65eb","sha1":"d751153e722a4e014691c83f39f5b07c6ec5333c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar","primary":true,"size":76237,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"98916c93bed3ca456c6f0de0f5b52a40a70f88c2d308414e02eb18fee3aeaefe2437fe3fc3cc29bc78a4d06258d158836e85216a7f2c66a838d2ff1b89853abe","sha1":"abfc1f2e2112efd147cd092122287d3d5a59e35d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"946f3003fbf087ad5a0361a317afb2bda73b69ce","sha512":"2f641413fc64371853e1ca07243348de5759d8e30f419347af8c2edc556c010297d8f45f088d4a394f0b5494bd951412c0b9d9dce2eaa29bd5bb0fdf97ac6acd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19734,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar"},"mods\\embeddium-0.3.28+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"7dea141e886090a463e4f28c65cffa4a2252985197214fcf48795ffc5c3e42c9cbad44dfa3c975ef1ffa63448f155ba787f95ca30231b404fc737808f5bba866","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"sk9rgfiA","slug":"embeddium","project_type":"mod","team":"4VBpO7y2","title":"Embeddium","description":"A performance-enhancing client mod (based on Sodium) prioritizing reliability & mod compatibility","body":"# Embeddium\n\nEmbeddium is a free and open-source performance mod for Minecraft clients.

shaderpacks.\n\nThis mod forces Flywheel's optimizations to be enabled.\n\nFor those using shaderpack and mods depend on Flywheel, this mod can significantly improve fps.\n\nIf you don't use shaderpack, this mod has no effect. Because Flywheel's optimizations are enabled by default.\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\n\n\nThe shaders that have been tested are:\n\n\n\nBSL\nComplementary\nComplementary Reimagined \nSEUS renewed\nSildurs Vibrant Shaders\nAstraLex\n\nNew supported shaderpacks after 0.2.0:\n\n\n\nKapa 5.1\nNostalgia\nRethinking Voxels\nSEUS PTGI HRR\n\n\n\nThere are some shaderpacks that are also supported, but not listed above, so you can test them by yourself.\n\n\n\nThis mod only supports some specific versions of Iris or Oculus !!!\n\n\n\nIris&OculusFlwCompat   Iris or Oculus\n\n0.2.2 ---- >= 1.6.13\n\n0.2.1 ---- >= 1.6.5\n\n0.2.0 ---- >= 1.6.2\n\n0.1.9 ---- >= 1.5 and <= 1.6.1\n\n0.1.7~0.1.8 ---- >= 1.4 and < 1.5\n\n0.1.6 below ---- <1.4\n\n\n\n## Principle\n\nFlywheel uses a method called GPU Instancing to render entities. It is very efficient when rendering a large number of repeating entities (e.g. gears in Create mod). But when you use iris and enable shaderpack, this optimization is disabled. Because flywheel needs to use its own shader to render these entities and flywheel's shader will no longer work when you enable shaderpack.\n\n\n\nThis mod will automatically merge flywheel's shader with the shader in shaderpack when shaderpack is enabled to be able to render entities using Instancing.\n\n\n\nWhen you have a large number of entities to render, there is a huge CPU bottleneck with the original rendering method. This means that the better your GPU is, the bigger the FPS improvement from Flywheel.\n\n\n\n## How to use it?\n\n\n\n1. Install Flywheel(Create has embedded flywheel so you don't need to install it separately now) and Iris (Oculus if you use forge).\n\n2. Install this mod.\n\n","published":"2024-01-09T14:29:56.738699Z","updated":"2024-06-05T15:25:09.777196Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":192044,"followers":79,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["H1ouLgRR","5ocHQiCL","XfTsz2M5","BBYE8uFO","CH0C91Te","NoEldI7u","RCITAe7H","ce9TjaVw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ndHYMY2K/7d3794f7fdc4974ce4386bfc3e0ec27140a33de5.png"},"version":{"id":"RCITAe7H","project_id":"ndHYMY2K","author_id":"hEAeItIf","featured":true,"name":"Oculus Flywheel Compat 1.20.1-0.2.5 for Oculus 1.7 above","version_number":"oculus-1.20.1-0.2.5","changelog":"Compatibility with Oculus 1.7.0 and DistantHorizons.\n\nThanks [holmraven](https://github.com/leon-o/iris-flw-compat/pull/116).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-05T15:22:59.554810Z","downloads":14971,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a57510b5f06f492ef61570e62339cf062fcb103dba0df726810ffb53155ee1eea3144f33851d59efaa8695efc08ea90688e23454d25d27e348676993905bb801","sha1":"c87704b10925302f8103a0323f868f93de436484"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ndHYMY2K/versions/RCITAe7H/oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar","filename":"oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar","primary":true,"size":65177,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"GchcoXML","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YrGnLWl3","user":{"id":"hEAeItIf","username":"leon-o","name":"Red Face","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/hEAeItIf/251111e97ba610a35ca3639a02ba7c0e5cb0a03f.jpg","bio":null,"created":"2024-01-09T14:28:28.295558Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar.disabled"},"mods\\FPS-Monitor-1.20-1.3.0.jar":{"sha512":"a0febb2cb3af21515d84080b8cd29c1aa8b0aeae5ce1fd72afbd6434b3ee3085e82468059094d830325e64a7fb6e32b323cf9ad069b263d2373948f7c81d7e4f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3AHrP4M0","slug":"fps-monitor","project_type":"mod","team":"JBDKbkEm","title":"FPS Monitor","description":"Displays FPS, Memory, Ping and more in-game and in the game bar.","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/1LtRXYe.png)\n## FPS Monitor \nis a lightweight, configurable and versatile tool to display game information on screen for easy access and readability.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n##

1.18.2+\n\n![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n![Github Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n[![This is a Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original-orange)](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot)\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a optimization mod and unofficial fork of Smooth Boot for Minecraft Forge 1.18.2+, If you have a PC with a older or lower end CPU (ex. CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing with your friends!\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.imgur.com/ytD8AVA.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/AbdElAziz333)\n\n**Thanks!**","published":"2022-11-02T05:54:53.998919Z","updated":"2024-01-08T01:33:06.845232Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":353710,"followers":162,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["e9Hq3hbv","3yzqBh3Y","qmq8DyRI","YXklcDpN","CSAWSThG","FpT1xZyZ","iGVkOHlW","gCz8FYyg","FzbfQajL","HkfL3iGO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/72c932a650b6ca3830a1dd82ee86eb7f05f589ef.png"},"version":{"id":"HkfL3iGO","project_id":"z53V2L4P","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Smooth Boot (Reloaded) 0.0.4 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.0.4","changelog":"This update uses a specific amount of main worker threads you can change it in the config, while the old updates uses the number of the available threads, resulting in worse performance.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T01:33:07.890390Z","downloads":124625,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1cf706491339f3efae0d48d0dd596f27a74fcfa8e94008d7ef55e18be8c6f3c437bb74020e48910e1cc724ad35894bffce94788fe8f765c37048d4cc532ba261","sha1":"3fd79132dba444bd109b5de4ad75dee06a48e130"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/z53V2L4P/versions/HkfL3iGO/smoothboot%28reloaded%29-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","filename":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":41044,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nBB8t1rq","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"smoothboot(reloaded)-mc1.20.1-0.0.4.jar"},"mods\\ContingameIME-1.0.7-1.20.1-forge.jar":{"sha512":"212a22430f78e570f3ad17cef818737885221fb61a8cba0689451e5975003d3a5f92f8113aa29fb37cea34020d3a04c0bed7e669ffba05af7d4d3a3b55ba47ce","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5Z2YdwIT","slug":"contingameime","project_type":"mod","team":"yPCBvHlM","title":"ContingameIME","description":"An unofficial continuation of IngameIME.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.
